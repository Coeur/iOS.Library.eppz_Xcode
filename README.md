Keep track of my color xCode color scheme here.

#### Colors with a sense

Expression categories are distributed along color wheel.
+ Classes, type names are yellowish
+ Methods, functions are teal-greenish
+ Variables, constants are red-orangee
+ Strings, numbers are in blue-cyan

Your classes are brighter
+ Framework Class, method, variable colors are a bit weakened (35%) to emphasize your responsibilities

#### Usage
Simply clone to `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes/` (create folder if not exist already), then restart xCode.
